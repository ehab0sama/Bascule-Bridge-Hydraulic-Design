# Hydraulic Bascule Bridge: Design & Vibration Optimization 🌉

## 📖 Project Overview
[cite_start]This project focuses on the mechanical design of a **Bascule (Movable) Bridge** operated by a hydraulic system[cite: 22]. [cite_start]The primary goal was to design a robust transmission path while mitigating operational vibrations and noise[cite: 24, 26].

## 🛠 Engineering Tasks
- [cite_start]**System Design:** Selected pumps and transmission lines for bridge opening/closing.
- [cite_start]**Vibration Mitigation:** Analyzed pump-induced vibrations and proposed damping solutions[cite: 25].
- [cite_start]**Noise Control:** Optimized hydraulic line routing to reduce noise generation during operation[cite: 26].
