# Hydraulic Operated Movable Bridge System 

##  Project Overview
This project involves the complete design and analysis of a hydraulic system used for operating a movable (bascule) bridge. The design covers everything from the fluid power transmission path to ensuring structural stability during motion.

##  Engineering & Design Tasks
- **Hydraulic Circuit Design:** Selected appropriate pumps and transmission lines for efficient bridge opening and closing operations.
- **Vibration Control:** Conducted detailed analysis of pump-induced vibrations and implemented damping solutions to protect the system.
- **Noise Mitigation:** Optimized the routing of hydraulic lines to reduce noise generation during operation.
- **Mechanical Safety:** Selected mechanical elements to ensure continuous and safe operation under load.

##  Repository Structure
- **`/CAD`**: 3D models and engineering drawings of the bridge and hydraulic layout.
- **`/Analysis`**: Calculations for pump selection and transmission line sizing.
- **`/Documentation`**: Technical reports detailing the design process.
